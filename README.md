# Fetch_Take_Home_Assignment

This repo contains the files necessary to answer the questions for the Fetch analytics engineering take home assignment. Below is a quick outline for the files:

-- Task 1: Review Existing Unstructured Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model
  -- You can find the ER diagram under the Fetch ER Diagram image. 
  -- For clarity, I renamed the following columns:
    -- Receipts table:
      -- _id --> receipt_id
      -- userId --> user_id
    -- Users table:
      -- _id --> user_id
    -- Brands table:
      -- _id --> brand_id

-- Task 2: Write queries that directly answer predetermined questions from a business stakeholder
  -- This is under the Fetch SQL Queries pdf. For my SQL code, I used Google Bigquery.

-- Task 3: Evaluate Data Quality Issues in the Data Provided
  -- I decided to continue using Google Bigquery. You can find the queries along with my quality takeaways in the Fetch SQL Queries pdf.

-- Task 4: Communicate with Stakeholders
  -- My crafted email to a stakeholder can be found under the Fetch Email pdf. Within this, I outlined a fictional situation to provide context to this email.
